# Weather-App Xcode 7 Swift 2

This is a simple weather app that displays weather data from [OpenWeatherMap.org](http://openweathermap.org). These files 
follow the tutorial on youtube [here](http://openweathermap.org).

The app also displays an image representing the weather condition along with the temperature, and any other information you 
might want to include.
